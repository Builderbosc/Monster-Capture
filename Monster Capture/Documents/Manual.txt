How to play!


Gameplay and Goals:
Run around a big open area, trying to catch as many monsters as possible!
There are two types of monsters:

Aggressive: Enemies that chase down the player and deal large damage when under contacted.

Passive: Enemies that run away from the player and deal only small amounts of damage.

There are four states an AI can be in:

Idle: Wanders around its origin.
Patrol: a short state for when the AI notices the player but doesn't see them.
Chasing: The state the AI is in, when running towards/away from the player.
Cornered: Same as chasing, but faster. However, the Ai sometimes gets tired and needs to stop briefly.



Controls:

W, A, S, D: Moves the character in the direction relative to the camera.
TAB: ends a run early, allowing you to access the  title screen/ quit the game/ restart a bad run.
Left Click: if not on cooldown, a trap is shot in the direction you are facing.

UI navigation:

almost all on-screen buttons can be directly interacted with by keyboard and mouse.
